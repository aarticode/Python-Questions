#What is a Module?
#Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

#A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

#Create a Module
#To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:
def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)

#Import the module named mymodule, and call the greeting function:

import my_module

import my_module

my_module.greeting("Aarti")
